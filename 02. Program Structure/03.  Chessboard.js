/*
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the 
grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should 
form a chessboard.

    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

                     # # # #
                    # # # # 
                     # # # #
                    # # # # 
                     # # # #
                    # # # # 
                     # # # #
                    # # # #

    When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8
and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given
width and height.

        hash_grid_string += " ";
      } else {
        hash_grid_string += "#";
      }
      
    } else {
      if (j % 2 == 0) {
        hash_grid_string += "#";
      } else {
        hash_grid_string += " ";
      }
